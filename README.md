# Moon Web Dev Agency

Moon is the name of a fictitious web development agency. This project's goal was to develop a website that showcased elegant transitions between the various pages, achieved with the help of the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). This project has a [demo](https://moon.luis-villa.com) on my personal website.
