# Moon Web Dev Agency

This website was designed for a mock web dev agency. The goal of this project was to practice creating custom JavaScript interactions. All animations and interactions were created using GSAP. This project has a [demo](https://luisvilla.xyz/projects/moon/demo) on my personal website.
